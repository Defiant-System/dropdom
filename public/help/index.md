### How to

Dropdom is a simple puzzle game that will keep you entertained for hours! Check out 
this block blaster game where your goal is to blast the jewel-colored blocks before 
it hits the top of the screen. Swipe the blocks left and right until they drop down 
and blast other blocks out of the screen by creating a single line of blocks. Every 
time you swipe, new blocks will be added from the bottom of the puzzle as it climbs 
up the screen making it more of a challenge.

However, your objective is to blast the blocks and keep them from hitting the top of 
the screen. Click on the leaderboard icon to view your score and see where you stand 
against other block blasters. At the end of each game, you will see your most recent 
and best score. Play again until you beat your best score and watch as you rise up 
the leaderboards beating out all of your friends.

This is a mobile-friendly game that you can play on either your mobile device or your computer!
